ssh:
  addresses: [ ":22" ]

session:
  type: fs

      ## If you only want to allow user with group "ssh" to log in, uncomment the following lines:
      #loginAllowed: |
      #  {{ or
      #    (.authorization.user.group.name | eq "ssh" )
      #    (.authorization.user.groups     | firstMatching `{{.name | eq "ssh" }}` )
