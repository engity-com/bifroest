# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

* We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
* Each version is supported until the next one is released (e.g. 1.1.x will be supported until 1.2.0 is out).
* Release Candidates are available before the release (e.g. 1.1.0-rc1, 1.1.0-rc2, 1.1.0-rc3, 1.1.0-rc4, before 1.1.0).
* Bug-fixes (e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.3) are released as needed (no additional features are delivered in those versions, bug-fixes only).
