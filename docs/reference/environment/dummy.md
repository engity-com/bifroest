# Dummy environment

An environment created for demonstration purposes, it simply prints a message and exists immediately.

This feature is usually only makes sense for cases where you want to create dummy configurations of Bifr√∂st to demonstrate some functionality, like we're utilizing it in our demonstration configurations: [contrib/configurations/dummy-windows.yaml](<<asset_url("contrib/configurations/dummy-windows.yaml")>>).


## Configuration {: #configuration}

<<property("type", "Environment Type", default="dummy", required=True)>>
Has to be set to `dummy` to enable the dummy environment.

<<property("banner", "string", template_context="../context/authorization.md", default="")>>
Will be displayed to the user upon connection to its environment.

<h4 id="property-banner-examples">Examples</h4>

1. If [simple user](../authorization/simple.md) is used, show its name in a message:
   ```yaml
   banner: "Hello, {{.authorization.entry.name}}!\n"
   ```
2. If [users authorized via OIDC](../authorization/oidc.md) is used, show its name in a message:
   ```yaml
   banner: "Hello, {{.authorization.idToken.name}}!\n"
   ```

<<property("exitCode", "int64", template_context="../context/authorization.md", default=0)>>
After [`banner`](#property-banner) was printed to the user, the environment will exit with this code.

### Examples {: #examples}

1. Simple:
   ```yaml
   type: dummy
   ```
2. With message:
   ```yaml
   type: dummy
   banner: "Hello, {{.authorization.idToken.name}}!\n"
   ```
