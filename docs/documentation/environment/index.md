# Environments

Bifröst executes their users into environments. These environments can be either the [local environment](local.md) of the host (where Bifröst runs on) itself or even containers (current in development [Docker](https://github.com/engity-com/bifroest/issues/11) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/engity-com/bifroest/issues/12)).

## Types

1. `local`: [Local](local.md)
